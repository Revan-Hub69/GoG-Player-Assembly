# Open Letter to Guns of Glory Developers

**Dear developers,**

First of all, thank you. Thank you for creating and maintaining a game that we deeply love. The numbers speak clearly: millions of active players, hundreds of servers worldwide, a community that continues to grow and invest in your universe after years. This success is your merit, your talent and dedication.

Guns of Glory is not just a game for us - it has become a digital second home where we have built friendships, alliances, memories. Many of us have been playing for years, investing time, passion and resources because we believe in the project you created.

**Why are we writing today?**

Not to complain, but to propose something constructive. In recent months we have noticed that dialogue between community and developers has become more difficult. Feedback gets lost in social media, player concerns struggle to reach you in a clear and organized way.

We believe this is nobody's fault - it's simply the natural result of a community that has grown a lot. But we also believe we can do better, together.

**Our proposal**

We would like to create a simple platform called "GOG Player Assembly" - a place where the community's voice can reach you in a more organized and constructive way.

The idea is simple:
- Each server elects a representative
- Representatives collect feedback from their players
- Proposals are discussed and voted on by the community
- We present only ideas that truly have majority support

**Why would this help you?**

Instead of having to filter hundreds of scattered messages on social media, you would have:
- Feedback already organized and prioritized by the community itself
- Identified and responsible interlocutors
- Proposals that truly represent general sentiment, not just the loudest voices

It's a best practice that many successful gaming companies have adopted - creating structured channels for community feedback. Not to give up control of development, but to make more informed decisions.

**What we are NOT proposing**

We want to be very clear: we are not trying to control your game or replace you in development decisions. It's not a platform to organize protests or boycotts. It's simply a way to better organize the dialogue that already exists.

**Our request**

We don't ask you to accept every proposal - we know you have the complete vision of the game and considerations we cannot see. We only ask for a little more dialogue:

- Recognize this initiative as a constructive attempt to improve communication
- Consider the proposals we will send (even if the answer will often be "no, because...")
- When possible, explain the "why" of your decisions

**Our commitment**

For our part, we commit to:
- Always maintain a respectful and constructive tone
- Present only well-reasoned proposals supported by the majority
- Accept your final decisions, even when we don't like them
- Continue to support and promote the game we love

**In conclusion**

This letter comes from love for Guns of Glory, not from frustration. We want the game to continue growing and prospering for years to come. We believe that more structured dialogue can help all of us - developers and players - achieve this goal.

You have created something special. Help us help you make it even greater.
